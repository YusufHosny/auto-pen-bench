    This class uses an OpenAI language model (LLM) to evaluate whether an agent 
    has reached specific milestones based on the agent's actions and 
    observations. It keeps track of both command milestones (specific tasks) 
    and stage milestones (overall progress).

        command_milestones (list): The loaded command milestones of the task
        stage_milestones (list): The loaded stage milestones of the task

    Attributes:
        evaluator (instructor.client.Instructor): The OpenAI LLM client
        model (str): The LLM to use (gpt-4o)
        reached_milestones (int): The current number of reached command milestones
        command_milestones (list): The loaded command milestones of the task
        stage_milestones (list): The loaded stage milestones of the task


    Methods:
        _evaluate(step, milestone): Call the LLM to evaluate the step
        evaluate_step(step): Determine if the agent accomplish a command milestone
